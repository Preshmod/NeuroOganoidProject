# NeuroOganoidProject

## Overview
This project aims to develop and refine computational methods to accurately quantify the architecture and behaviour of complex 3D tissues, using human brain organoids as a model of developing neuroepithelia. Unlike traditional 2D cultures, these organoids better represent real tissue structures. Using MATLAB and machine learning to study features such as cell and nucleus shapes, division positioning, and tissue patterns. Starting with 2D Z-sections and progressing to 3D reconstructions, the project will compare normal organoids with genetically edited or drug-treated ones to assess the methodâ€™s effectiveness in detecting structural and phenotypic changes.
